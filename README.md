# Data

Data is a part of a project we had to do for the university. This part is coded in Python. The application reads a in a puzzle (similar to sudoku) from a text file and generates a Protocol Buffer file to transfer the data of the puzzle to a solver which is written in Java. It also contains the part to get the solved puzzle via Protocol Buffer and generates a text file with the solved puzzle.
